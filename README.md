## Amazon nut models (2021/2041-2060)

At this repository you can take a look on the results of all models that were generated during my whole scientific initiation using an ensemble of 10 algorithms, considering the variables selected through variance inflation factor (VIF). 
Two scenarios for the future were simulated for different filters, check out all the results through this [link](https://gabrielforest.github.io/maps_grid/). 
  
Some of the results you can see below:
