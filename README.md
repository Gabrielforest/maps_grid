## Amazon nut models (Present/2041-2060)

In this repository, you can explore the results of the main models generated during my research, which used an ensemble of 10 algorithms to create a suitability map for the Amazon nut tree. Two future scenarios were simulated using different filters. You can view the results through this [link](https://gabrielforest.github.io/maps_grid/).
