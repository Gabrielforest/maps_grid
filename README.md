Amazon nut models (2021/2041-2060)

All the models were generated using an ensemble of 10 GCMs, considering the variables selected through variance inflation factor (VIF). 
Two scenarios for the future were simulated for different filters, check out all the results through this [link](https://gabrielforest.github.io/maps_grid/).
